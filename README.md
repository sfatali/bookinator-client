Dependencies:
1) Bootstrap as CSS (and sometimes a bit of JS) framework.
2) JQuery as assisting JS library
3) NotifyJS as a library for notifications

Installation process:
No installation required, just having the sources of those dependensies does the work.

How to run application:
Open main.html in the browser.

Client-side tests:
None so far

Files in the project implemented by me:
Everything except notify.js
